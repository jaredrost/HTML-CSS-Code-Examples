<h3> Bio </h3>
    <p>     My name is Jared Rostkowski. I am currently a sophomore at  <a href="http://www.stonehill.edu/">Stonehill College</a>, majoring in <a href="http://web.stonehill.edu/compsci/index0.htm">Computer Science</a>. I grew up in a small town north of Boston called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockport,_Massachusetts">Rockport</a>, Massachusetts. There, I went Rockport High School, where I played Baseball, Basketball, and Soccer. Computer Science wasn't an interest of mine in High School, mostly due to the fact that it wasn't offered at my High School. My interest in computers is what drew me towards my major, and I haven't looked back </p>
