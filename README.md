# HTML-CSS-Code-Examples

This repository contains examples of HTML and CSS work I completed my Sophomore year of College
<br>
It mainly consists of two projects: one of my first projects, which is a "getting to know you" simple website
<br>
and my final project of the semester: A casual, account based website that allows the user to schedule an open sporting event, in which users can add friends 
and make event
