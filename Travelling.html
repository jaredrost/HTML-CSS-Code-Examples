        <p>Travelling is a very new interest of mine, due to the fact that I did very little of it up until High School. Before High School, I had only been to Canada a couple times and Flordia once. But since my Junior Year of High School I have to wide variety countries each with Cultural and Natural Beauty.</p>

    <h3>Peru</h3>
    <p>I went to Peru in the April of my Junior Year of High School. I went down to Peru to do two weeks of volunteer work with my older brother Matt, who had already been down there for a couple months. The was a very great learning experience for me, one reason being that I had to travel alone on the way down to Peru. Getting through a foreign airport was an especially daunting task. I travelled all over Peru, inlcuding Machu Pichu and Lake Titicaca(see above). I also learned a lot about the culture of Peru, about native tribes and the way of life that they and modern Peruvians lived. I spoke better Spanish than the 6 years of Spanish I took in school. The trip was arguably the best two weeks of my life.   </p>

    <h4>Iceland</h4> 
    <p>I went to Iceland this past Summer with my Dad to visit one of his friends from college. Another reason of going is that the UEFA EURO soccer tournement was going on and this was Iceland's first time being in a major tournment. Watching the games in pubs who were really passionate about the game was a surreal experience. Not only that, but the natural beauty of Iceland was austounding. I got to walk on Glaciers and behind Waterfalls. One of the most unbelievable things is that, once you got out of the city, there were no trees. None of the mountains had trees, and being from New England, that's vastly different from what I was used to.</p>

    <h5>Dominican Republic/FLorida Keys/St. Maarten</h5>
    <p> These three are combined becasue they were all family vacations, on consecutive winter breaks(2015-2017), all to tropical places. They are all pretty self-explanatory. Beautiful beaches, big resorts, clear water, warm weather, and amazing sunsets</p>
