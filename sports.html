        <p>Playing sports are some of the earliest memories I have. When I was young, my parents introduced me to a lot of sports, including Baseball, Basketball, Soccer, Hockey, Football and Golf. The ones that stuck were Basketball, Baseball, and Soccer. I played all 3 of the sports up until my sophomore year of High School, when I only continued playing Varsity Soccer and Basketball until I graduated. My proudest moment would have to be playing with both my brothers in a Varsity game on my older brother Matt's senior night, as it was the first and last time I played a competitve soccer game with both of my brothers.</p>
    <h2>Favorite Sports Teams</h2> 
        <p> Growing up near Boston has obivously lead me to cheering for all the Boston sports teams. Favorite players including Tom Brady, Paul Pierce, David Ortiz, etc. My favorite non-Boston athlete is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirk_Nowitzki">Dirk Nowitzski</a> </p>
